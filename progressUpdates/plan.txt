4. Development Plan

You can implement it in these stages:

Stage 1 — Setup Kafka locally (in Docker)

Use Bitnami Kafka or Confluent image

Create topic: network_logs

Stage 2 — Stream Data

Write a Python script to replay a dataset like CIC-IDS2018 as JSON logs

Push to Kafka every 1–2 seconds to simulate live flow

Stage 3 — Consume Data + Detect Anomalies

Build a consumer.py that reads logs

Apply your ML model (Isolation Forest or Autoencoder)

Stage 4 — Integrate with LangGraph

Define nodes for:

Enrichment

Correlation

Detection

Triage (LLM reasoning)

Stage 5 — Visualize Alerts

Push final outputs to Streamlit dashboard or Kibana index
